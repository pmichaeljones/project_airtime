      In 2000 something Chris suffered a life altering spinal cord injury which resulted in him spending some time in a wheelchair.As good fortune would have it, he made a 120% recovery but was left with a different view of the world and an improved view of life.
    %p
      He went from a wholehearted "look at me and look what I can do" sort of attitude to a world where the only question was, What can I do for you?

      Chris answered that question by devoting his life to taking everyone flying, with no exception.
