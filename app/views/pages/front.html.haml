        What is Project Airtime?
      %p.homepage-column{:style=>"font-size: 14px;"}
        Project Airtime is a Nevada 501 (c) 3 non profit based in Draper, UT. We take EVERYONE flying. When we save EVERYONE - we mean it. No exclusions. From special needs individuals to those with brain and spinal cord injuries - those with illness, the elderly and veterans - our co-pilots have one thing in common - they want to fly!

        How Do I Go Flying?
      %p.homepage-column{:style=>"font-size: 14px;"}
        Fill out the contact form below, and Chris will give you a call to discuss getting you strapped in and flying with him. You'll go over travel and lodging logistics, as well as any flying specifics. If you've got a question, he has the answer. Flying normally takes place at Point of the Mountain, Utah, but can be arranged in other locations as well.
